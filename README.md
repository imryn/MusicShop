# My Music Shop

my first Angular project. it is a small music shop divided to 4 pages. at the home page, you can see all albums at the shop. you can choose the album you want to buy and add it to your cart, then move forward to your own cart. you can search for a specific album, send connection info and read about the website.
the website is being programmed by Angular 7 and C# using .NET. also, uses a bootstrap library for responsive.
you can see my back end programming in [myMusicServer](https://github.com/imryn/myStore-server). 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help
To get more help on running the project you can email to: noyimry@gmail.com.
